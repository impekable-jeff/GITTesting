Greetings Citizen. It’s time for CitizenCon!
Four years ago, we began our historic crowdfunding campaign for Star Citizen.
It’s incredible to think about where we are now compared to where we started.
Today, there are over 350 employees at four offices across the world
delivering the game of your dreams and theirs.

This Sunday, October 9th at 3pm PDT (10pm GMT), join us in celebrating this
incredible journey at CitizenCon. The event will be broadcast live from Los
Angeles. We’re excited to show you the progress we’ve made on a number of
fronts, but don’t want to spoil the surprise, so make sure to tune in to our
Twitch livestream to see exactly what we have planned.

Also, we’ve got a number of fun things planned leading up to the main event.
From gameplay live streams to fan gatherings, there are plenty of ways to
engage with the Star Citizen community and devs before Sunday’s show. You can
find the specifics of these events in our CitizenCon 2946 Details post.
